# Color-Game
In this project I have used **CSS,HTML and Javascript**.<br>
Its a responsive website.<br>
We have to guess the color based on the RGB values<br>
It has two levels-easy and hard.<br>
It gives a new set of colors when a player wins or when the player resets the game.<br>
Here are some previews:<br>
**Level:HARD**<br>
