# Color-Game
- In this project I have used **CSS,HTML and Javascript**.
- Its a responsive website.
- We have to guess the color based on the RGB values
- It has two levels-easy and hard.
- It gives a new set of colors when a player wins or when the player resets the game.
# Here are some previews:<br>
